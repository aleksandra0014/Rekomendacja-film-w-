# Movie recommender 
The project involves creating a "website" using the streamlit library where users can find similar movies to their favorites, movies featuring a specific actor, or specific genres. I utilized the nltk library to generate such recommendations because the recommendation process primarily relies on movie descriptions. A demonstration of its functionality can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uSjn8Tx2xULZy_s1wnHlLF_mwqxtrrD/view?usp=sharing
Libraries used: pandas, streamlit, scikit-learn, pickle, nltk, requests.
